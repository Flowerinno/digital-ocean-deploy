# Client side

Deploying client side on app platform, similar to S3 static side, but no quite. App platform is a container that runs your code. Will be delivered via CDN. Choose the closest region.

### Click on Create -> App

1. Attach github repo
2. Source dir /client
3. Names as domain
4. Change Web Service -> Static Site on creation
5. No changes in the build command
6. Custom pages -> CatchAll -> index.html
7. After app is deployed you can create domain/dns with your domain name (Create -> Domains/DNS)
